# Weed Detection & Autonomous Navigation Robot

This project is an AI-powered autonomous robot designed for smart weed detection and navigation.

## Features
- ðŸŒ± **ML Model**: Identifies weeds using image processing.
- ðŸ›  **FPGA Path Planning**: Uses Verilog for autonomous navigation.
- ðŸ¤– **Walking Robot**: Controlled via Arduino.

## Folder Structure
- `ML_Model/` â†’ Machine Learning scripts for weed detection.
- `FPGA_PathPlanning/` â†’ Verilog code for robot path planning.
- `WalkingRobot/` â†’ Arduino C code for robot movement.
- `Integration_Plan/` â†’ Notes on integrating all components.
- `docs/` â†’ Architecture diagrams & extra documentation.

## Future Work
- ðŸ”— **Integrate ML model with FPGA and robot hardware.**
- ðŸ›  **Optimize the ML model for real-time execution on FPGA.**
